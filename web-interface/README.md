# Web Interface

The web interface is used to sign permits and generate Poseidon hash from input of the form found in the Cleveland heart disease dataset. To start serving the web interface navigate into this directory and start a simple HTTP server by running `python3 -m http.server` or `python -m http.server` / `py -3 -m http.server` if you're using Windows. Make sure that the Poseidon hash API is running before attempting to generate a Poseidon hash in the web interface.
